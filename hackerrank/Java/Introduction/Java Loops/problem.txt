In this problem you will test your knowledge of Java loops. Given three integers a, b, and n, output the following series:

a+20b,a+20b+21b,......,a+20b+21b+...+2n−1b

Input Format

The first line will contain the number of testcases t. Each of the next t lines will have three integers, a, b, and n.

Constraints:

0≤a,b≤50
1≤n≤15
Output Format

Print the answer to each test case in separate lines.
