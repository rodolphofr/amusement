In most of the Hackerrank challenges, you need to read input from stdin (standard input) and write your output in stdout (standard output).

One way to take input from stdin is to use Scanner class and reading from System.in.

You can write your output to stdout simply using System.out.printf function.

In this problem you need to read 3 integers from stdin and print them in stdout.
