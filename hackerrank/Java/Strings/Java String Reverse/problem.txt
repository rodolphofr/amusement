A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters which reads the same backward or forward.(Wikipedia)

Given a string A, print "Yes" if it is a palindrome, print "No" otherwise. The strings will consist lower case english letters only. The strings will have at most 50 characters.

Some examples of palindromes are "madam", "anna", "reviver".
