Read 3 double numbers (A, B and C) representing the sides of a triangle and arrange them in decreasing order, so that the side A is the biggest of the three sides. Next, determine the type of triangle that they can make, based on the following cases always writing an appropriate message:
if A â‰¥ B + C, write the message: NAO FORMA TRIANGULO
if A2 = B2 + C2, write the message: TRIANGULO RETANGULO
if A2 > B2 + C2, write the message: TRIANGULO OBTUSANGULO
if A2 < B2 + C2, write the message: TRIANGULO ACUTANGULO
if the three sides are the same size, write the message: TRIANGULO EQUILATERO
if only two sides are the same and the third one is different, write the message: TRIANGULO ISOSCELES
Input

The input contains three double numbers, A (0 < A) , B (0 < B) and C (0 < C).

Output

Print all the classifications of the triangle presented in the input.
