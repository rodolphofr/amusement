Make a program that calculates and print the volume of a sphere given the radius (R) of the circle. The formula to calculate the volume is: (4/3) * pi * R3. For the purposes of this problem the value of pi is 3.14159.

Tip: Use (4/3.0) or (4.0/3) in your formula, because some languages (including C++) assume that the result dividing two integers is another integer. :)

Input

The input file contain an integer number.

Output

The output file will contain a message like the following example. Remember the space before and after the equal signal. The value must be printed with 3 digits after the decimal point.
